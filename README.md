Machine Learning experiments with Python

This repo is a collection of ipython (jupyter) notebooks. Each notebook attempts to cover some concept in machine learning. 
Since it is diffcult to cover the entire methodology and related stuff in a single notebook without making it confusing, my approach is to put some fundamental concepts down first and then create more notebooks in future on more advanced stuff.

## Contents
* <a href = "./linear_regression/multiple_variables.ipynb">Linear regresion - Multiple features</a>
* <a href = "./logistic_regression/binary_classification.ipynb">Logistic regresion - Binary classification</a>
